UI Context: Arc-Inspired Glassmorphism
Windsurf’s interface fuses glassmorphism’s frosted glass effects with Arc’s design language:

Side Navigation: Like Arc, key navigation and controls are placed in a left sidebar, maximizing horizontal space and reducing top-bar clutter. This sidebar houses prompt input, aspect ratio selection, and generation controls.

Minimal Top Bar: The top of the app remains clean or empty, echoing Arc’s “nothing at the top” look, which prioritizes content and workspace.

Spaces & Theming: Users can switch between different “spaces” or themes for varied creative sessions, inspired by Arc’s organizational approach.

Floating Cards: Generated images and controls appear in floating, glassmorphic cards with blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds, subtle gradients, and soft borders for depth.

Vivid Backgrounds: The background features vibrant gradients or imagery, shining through the frosted layers, enhancing the sense of depth and modernity.

Minimal, Calming Layout: The overall feel is uncluttered, with thoughtful spacing, rounded corners, and smooth transitions, creating a calm, focused environment.

Microinteractions & Animations: Subtle hover and press states, along with smooth transitions, echo Arc’s attention to delightful microinteractions.

App Structure & Key Features
Left Sidebar: Prompt input, aspect ratio selector, and generate button in a vertical, glassmorphic panel.

Main Workspace: Displays generated images in large, centered glass cards, with download and share options.

Theme/Space Switcher: Quick access to different creative “spaces” or color themes.

Responsive Design: Adapts gracefully to desktop and mobile, maintaining Arc’s side-focused navigation and glassmorphic effects.

Instructions for Building the App
1. Project Setup

Initialize a React.js project (Vite or Create React App recommended).

Install Tailwind CSS (or similar) for rapid glassmorphism utility.

Add Together AI SDK:

text
npm i together-ai
2. Arc-Inspired Glassmorphism UI

Build a persistent left sidebar for navigation and controls, using translucent backgrounds, backdrop blur, and soft borders.

Keep the top bar minimal or absent, focusing all controls in the sidebar or floating cards.

Use vivid, gradient backgrounds that interact visually with glassmorphic panels.

Implement floating cards for image display, with rounded corners, subtle drop shadows, and border highlights.

Add microinteractions (hover, focus, pressed states) and smooth transitions for a polished feel.

3. Core Functionality

Implement prompt input, aspect ratio selection, and generate button in the sidebar.

On generation, call the Together AI FLUX API and display the resulting image in a floating card.

Provide download and sharing options for generated images.

4. Theme/Space Management

Allow users to switch between different themes or “spaces,” changing background gradients and accent colors, inspired by Arc’s organizational features.

5. Responsiveness & Accessibility

Ensure the layout adapts to different devices, keeping the sidebar and glassmorphic elements usable and visually appealing.

Use accessible color contrasts and ARIA labels.
